## Introduction

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in the United States and Canada. However, is it really possible to predict NBA players’ salaries based on their performances? 

In order to gain more insight on the relationship between NBA players’ performances and their salaries and investigate how a player’s performance one year affects their salary in the next year, we have chosen each NBA player's stats associated with their performances in the 2018-2019 season from RealGM and each NBA player’s salary in the 2019-2020 season from ESPN. 

In this study, we analyze the data of NBA players’ performances to predict their salaries in the next year. By building a statistical model, we explore the insights of how large an impact each element of NBA players’ performances has on their next year salaries. Furthermore, with the data of each NBA player’s salary from ESPN, we are able to examine how closely NBA players’ performances are related to their salaries.
